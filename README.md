School District Analysis
Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate suspected academic dishonesty. We compared student performance relative to school funding, size, and type of school.  In this analysis we replaced the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keep the rest of the data intact and did comparisons of the data to see effects of the changes.  
……
Results:
The district summary was not affected. The school summary was drastically affected by altering Thomas High Schools data and removing the 9th grade test scores.  It improved its ranking among other schools immensely.  Math and reading scores slightly improved when removing THS 9th grade test scores. When removing all 9th grade student date it does look like the scores overall did improve.
Summary:
In summary it is hard to say if there was academic dishonesty going on with the analysis of the data.
